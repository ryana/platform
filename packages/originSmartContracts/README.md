# OriginProtocol Smart Contracts Documentation

![Codeship Status](https://app.codeship.com/projects/279083/status?branch=master)

## Introduction

This is very much a work in progress. Please refer to our [Discord](http://originprotocol.com/discord)
before trying to do any work based on the code in this repository :)

## Getting started

In a terminal window:

```
testrpc
```

Then:

```
truffle test
```

Despite being super early, we're going to do our best to make sure tests always pass!
If the tests don't pass, either something is wrong with your setup, or you found a
genuine bug. Please join our #engineering channel on Discord and report it!

###Network Addresses
